export const LINT_RESULTS = `### Code Quality Status

This section shows the current code quality status from static analysis.

IMPORTANT: This lint output reflects the CURRENT state of the codebase BEFORE the proposed modification.

Use this to understand:
- Current code quality issues that need attention
- Whether code quality should be addressed before new features
- Patterns of issues that may indicate architectural concerns

Note: During TDD red phase (failing tests), focus on making tests pass before addressing lint issues.
During green phase (passing tests), lint issues should be addressed before proceeding to new features.
