export const TEST_OUTPUT = `### Test Output

This section shows the output from the most recent test run BEFORE this modification.

IMPORTANT: This test output is from PREVIOUS work, not from the changes being reviewed. The modification has NOT been executed yet.

Use this to understand:
- Which tests are failing and why (from previous work)
- What error messages indicate about missing implementation
- Whether tests are passing (indicating refactor phase may be appropriate)

Note: Test output may be from unrelated features. This does NOT prevent starting new test-driven work.
