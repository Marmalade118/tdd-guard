export const TODOS = `### Todo List

This section shows the developer's task list. Use this to understand:
- What the developer is currently working on (in_progress)
- What has been completed (completed)
- What is planned next (pending)
Note: Multiple pending "add test" todos don't justify adding multiple tests at once.
